                    resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields

                    dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.<br>  Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
